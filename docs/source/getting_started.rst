Getting Started
===============

``Coba`` is a contextual bandit research package made for algorithmic and applied research.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're brand-new to ``Coba`` the first step is to install it. This can be done easily via pip.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install coba

Key Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Coba`` package is organized around five key concepts.

.. note::
   ``Coba`` is organized around five key concepts:

   1. Environments -- models of CB problems
   2. Learners -- solvers of CB problems
   3. Evaluators -- evaluations of learners on environments
   4. Experiments -- logic to create Results given environment/learners/evaluators
   5. Results -- data generated by experiments

   Knowing these concepts can help you find help and perform advanced experiments.

The core concepts help in finding more information about ``Coba``. For example, all built-in learners can be
found at :ref:`coba-learners`. Help with creating environments can be found at :ref:`coba-environments`. The types of evaluation
that coba supports out of the box can be found at :ref:`coba-evaluators`. The various ways an experiment can be configured is
described at :ref:`coba-experiments`. And details regarding analysis functionality can be found at :ref:`coba-results`.

 * For *all* researchers we suggest reading about how to create your :doc:`first experiment <First_Experiment>`.
 * For *algorithm* researchers we suggest reading about how to create :doc:`custom learners <Learners>`.
 * For *applied* researchers we suggest reading about creating :doc:`custom environments <Environments>`.
