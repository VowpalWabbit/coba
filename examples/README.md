This directory contains a number of example experiments, scripts and jupyter notebooks. 

For all these examples it is assumed that the dependencies in environment.yml file have been installed. 

If you are running locally the easiest way to install the dependencies is by using conda to create environment.yml.

If you are viewing this on the web you use this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VowpalWabbit/Coba/HEAD?filepath=examples/notebooks) to start a Jupyter environment with all dependencies installed.
